### Introduction
This project focuses on controlling a DC motor using an Arduino in an open-loop configuration. In an open-loop system, the motor operates based only on the input commands provided, without using feedback to adjust its performance.

The aim of this experiment is to control the motor’s speed and direction through programmed signals and observe how the motor responds. This helps develop an understanding of basic motor control principles and introduces key concepts used in robotics and embedded systems.
